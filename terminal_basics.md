## A Short Terminal Primer for UNIX-like Systems

#### What is a Terminal?

+ A terminal is a general term that stands for any text-only mode of interaction with an Operating System.
+ The essence of a terminal environment is the notion of the **READ EVALUATE PRINT LOOP (aka, REPL)** which reads your commands, executes them, and then waits for your next command.
+ Terminals used to be connected to a large multi-user computer with some number of 'slots' for users to manipulate the machine at once.  Terminals as we use them in our class are really virtual terminals, in that they run inside a graphical environment, not on their own.  The Apple Terminal is a sort of front-end for what we consider to really be the terminal, aka the REPL loop with the  `student@computer ~$` prompt.  Bash is the 'shell' that shows us this prompt and takes our input
+ Bash?
+ Yes, Bash. Bash is 1) a shell that manipulates the Operating System and 2) the programming language that you use to manipulate the Operating System.   It works hand in hand with the lower levels of OS X that the user isn't able to access.
+ When you login to a terminal, you see `student@computer ~$`.  This is a Bash prompt.
