+ A terminal is a general term that stands for any text-only mode of interaction with an Operating System.
+ The essence of a terminal environment is the notion of the **READ EVALUATE PRINT LOOP (aka, REPL)** which reads your commands, executes them, and then waits for your next command.
+ The Terminal application we use on our mac is a simulation of the old-school, pre-GUI terminal, which was an interface to a mainframe. It packages the programs that work together to make up the terminal environment that runs on OS X.  It is a convenience, but it doesn't provide the interactive loop itself.  Bash does that.
+ Bash?
+ Yes, Bash. Bash is 1) a shell that manipulates the Operating System and 2) the programming language that you use to manipulate the Operating System.   It works hand in hand with the lower levels of OS X that the user isn't able to access.
+ When you login to a terminal, you see `student@computer ~$`.  This is a Bash prompt.

+ Think of the word 'terminal' as a sort of 'kleenex' type of word, where it stands for a general prompt.
