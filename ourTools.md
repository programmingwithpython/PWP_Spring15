# A Quick Review of the Tools We Are Using

* We are writing our python scripts in TextWrangler and saving them to our Desktop as <filename>.py
* We are using the Mac Terminal application to access our operating system as it is represented through text.
* With Terminal, we navigate from our 'Student' home directory to our desktop by doing 'cd Desktop'.
* From there, we use the python interpreter to run the .py file we saved there by doing 'python string1.py' for example
