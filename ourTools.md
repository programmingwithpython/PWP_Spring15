## Our Workflow & Tools

#### IPYTHON

+ We can test our Python ideas in an application called IPython (interactive python). IPython lets us run a program line by line instead of all at once.  The value is that we get immediate feedback about our code.

````bash
student: ~$ ipython
# starts IPython
In [1]: w = 'python'
In [2]: print w
python
In [3]:
````

* After testing our ideas out in IPython, we write our full Python programs in a text editor like TextWrangler, and save them to either /Users/Student or /Users/Student/Desktop.
* We run our Python programs 
* 

IPYTHON       -> Testing
TEXT-WRANGLER -> Writing our Full Program
TERMINAL      -> We run our Python program here and we can navigate the Operating System in its text representation.

* From there, we use the python interpreter to run the .py file we saved there by doing 'python string1.py' for example
