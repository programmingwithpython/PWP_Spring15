## Our Workflow & Tools

#### IPYTHON

+ We can test our Python ideas in an application called IPython (interactive python). IPython lets us run a program line by line instead of all at once.  The value is in the immediate feedback we get about our code.

````bash
student: ~$ ipython
# starts IPython
In [1]: w = 'python'
In [2]: print w
python
In [3]:
````

#### TextWrangler
* We can write our full Python programs in a text editor like TextWrangler.  Once we're done, we can save this file to a file ending in '.py' in the ````bash /Users/Student```` or ````bash /Users/Student/Desktop directories````.

#### The Apple Terminal
* We run our Python programs as ````python python myprog.py```` in the Apple Terminal

````bash
student: ~$ python myprog.py
please enter a number and I will square it:
````

#### Review

Ipython         -> Testing individual lines of code
Text-wrangler   -> Writing our Full Program
Apple Terminal  -> We run our Python program from the Apple Terminal and we can navigate the Operating System in its text representation.
