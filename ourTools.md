## Our Workflow & Tools

#### IPYTHON

+ We test our Python ideas in the IPython shell. This gives us immediate feedback about our python statements.

````bash
student: ~$ ipython
Python 2.7.8 |Anaconda 2.1.0 (x86_64)| (default, Aug 21 2014, 15:21:46) 
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

IPython 2.2.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
Anaconda is brought to you by Continuum Analytics.

?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
%quickref -> Quick reference.
help      -> Python's own help system.
object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.

* After testing our ideas out in IPython, we write our full Python programs in a text editor like TextWrangler, and save them to either /Users/Student or /Users/Student/Desktop.
* We run our Python programs 
* 

IPYTHON       -> Testing
TEXT-WRANGLER -> Writing our Full Program
TERMINAL      -> We run our Python program here and we can navigate the Operating System in its text representation.

* From there, we use the python interpreter to run the .py file we saved there by doing 'python string1.py' for example
