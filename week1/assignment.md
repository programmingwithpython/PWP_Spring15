## List Exercises

**Task**: Print the number of unique words in the sentence below:

"Thrift is poetic because it is creative; waste is unpoetic because it is waste."


If you'd prefer to develop your own approach, feel free.  However, if you want more guidance, here are some explicit steps:

+ Assign the sentence to a variable called s.
+ Make sure that you know how to select each word in the string s using the string slicing syntax we went over in class.
+ Put each word from s into a new list called words using string slicing syntax.
+ Use the set() function to turn words into a set of unique words in the sentence.
+ Print out the number of unique words in the sentence.
