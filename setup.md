# Standard Class Setup
1. Open a Terminal ( &#8984; + Spacebar, then 'Terminal')
2. Type 'cd Desktop'
3. Type 'pwd' and confirm you're in the desktop directory (should say something like '/Users/Student/Desktop')
4. Type &#8984;-N to open a new tab
5. In the new tab, type 'ipython'
6. Type 'pwd' to confirm you're on the desktop (should say u'/Users/Student/Desktop'). Now we have python in one tab and a Mac terminal prompt in the other.
7. Open Text Wrangler (&#8984; + Spacebar, then 'TextWrangler')
8. Save a file to the desktop called 'week<N>.py' where N is the week we are on.  

# NOTE: We use iPython to try out basic ideas like looping over a list. We use TextWrangler to write complete functions and programs.
