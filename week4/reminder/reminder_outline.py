A bare-bones task management application

TODAY

0. Talk about our schema
1. set up an sqlite3 database 
2. get user's task information 
3. convert the user's date and time information into a datetime object
4. commit our formatted user input to the database
5. get the <N> most recent tasks 

NEXT WEEK:

1. Improve the interface so we have options to ...
2. Provide task modification capabilities
3. modify our program so it takes command line arguments. Args include:
 - Number of weeks out to show tasks for
4. Abstract our database into a module and import that
5. Load schema from a file with executescript method
6. Have the reminder.py script email us with upcoming events
