## Outline

#### Functions:
+ week 3 exercise
+ Function Stack, for loop over a list of functions
+ Recursion Examples, Recursion vs Iteration

#### Tuples
+ like a list, but immutable, aka read-only
+ use case: homogenous data
+ a tuple, aka, an n-tuple, is a read-only quasi-list structure of N items
+ much better performance than a list due to immutability

#### Dictionaries
+ see my [slides] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K2zssbmjiyTwdSCUajrJADRrKvELNCGsfcs2ak8EDu8/edit?usp=sharing)
+ Syntax, use cases
+ creating dictionaries
+ creating dictionaries out of lists using dict(zip(lista,listb))

#### Entering Data into a Database using Python Dictionaries
+ taking raw_input data and entering it into our local database
+ sqlite setup (connection, cursor, select statements, rows, committing data)
