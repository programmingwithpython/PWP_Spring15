## Further Directions and Resources

#### Web Development

+ Flask: A small, but extensible web framework that lets you build dynamic websites using HTML templates. I recommend it if you are interested in building a website with Python (versus PHP, for example).

+ MongoDB: MongoDB is a noSQL database that has bindings to many languages, one of which is Python.  It provides a Python API that is very intuitive and uses the same syntax as the Python dictionary and JSON to model documents.

#### Text-Processing

#### Data Visualization

#### Podcasts

+ [Programming Throwdown] - My favorite podcast because the hosts are interesting and have a wide variety of interests.   It isn't focused on Python specifically, though there is a Python episode, however, it touches on a wide variety of general topics related to programming.  

+ [Talk Python To Me](http://www.talkpythontome.com/) - A very new podcast that focuses sometimes on a wide variety of things related to python, such as the Pyramid Web Framework, MongoDB's Python API, Docker, teaching Python, and more.

+ [Podcast.__init__](http://www.podcastinit.com/) - These guys have great guests.

+ [CodeNewbie](http://codenewbie.org) - A Good podcast that deals with the tech industry from the perspective of someone trying to get his or her first job.
