## Further Directions and Resources

#### Forward

If you enjoy programming and want to either 1) get way better at it in an efficient way, inclusive or 2) you want to get get a job doing it, then here is a suggestion: find a mentor, find a hero, find someone you admire, find someone you can hack with. There is a lot of talk today about finding a mentor, by which people mean take various measures to convince someone to take you under his or her wing. This is great advice, but you can also just do your research:  get a sense of the community that uses the language you do and follow the people that seem worth following (twitter, github, youtube, etc). Read their code, read their blogs, read their books, etc.  Knowing who is in the field and what they are working on is a great way to get in touch with the present problems in the community and a great way to see how someone is approaching them. 



#### Pycon Talks

+ pyvideo.org

#### Peter Norvig's course on Udacity

+ This explores 'Pythonic' problem-solving in a uncommonly great way
+ [Design of Computer Programs] (https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212)

#### Web Development

+ Flask: A small, but extensible web framework that lets you build dynamic websites using HTML templates. I recommend it if you are interested in building a website with Python (versus PHP, for example).

+ MongoDB: MongoDB is a noSQL database that has bindings to many languages, one of which is Python.  It provides a Python API that is very intuitive and uses the same syntax as the Python dictionary and JSON to model documents.

#### Text-Processing

#### Data Visualization

#### Podcasts

+ [Programming Throwdown] - My favorite podcast because the hosts are interesting and have a wide variety of interests.   It isn't focused on Python specifically, though there is a Python episode, however, it touches on a wide variety of general topics related to programming.  

+ [Talk Python To Me](http://www.talkpythontome.com/) - A very new podcast that focuses sometimes on a wide variety of things related to python, such as the Pyramid Web Framework, MongoDB's Python API, Docker, teaching Python, and more.

+ [Podcast.__init__](http://www.podcastinit.com/) - These guys have great guests.

+ [CodeNewbie](http://codenewbie.org) - A Good podcast that deals with the tech industry from the perspective of someone trying to get his or her first job.
