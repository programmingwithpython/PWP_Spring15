## Function Exercise

+ Write a program that doubles the square of a third of the reverse of the max of this list: [01,94,30,3.0,53]. 
+ It should have five functions that do the work of accepting arguments and calling them, plus a main function that 'wraps' the program.

Please try any approach you like but don't do this: 

def main():

    return func5(func4(func3(func2(func1()))))

main()

# variations:
# while loop f[num]()
# for loop num()
