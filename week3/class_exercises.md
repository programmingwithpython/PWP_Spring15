## Loop 'equivalence'

#### While loop

````python

n = 0
while n < 5:
  print n
  n = n + 1
````

#### For loop


````python

for n in range(5):
  print n

````

#### Questions:
+ In the while loop, why would it be a bad idea to print `n` on the last line of the loop?
+ What is the value of `n` after the for loop completes? after the while loop completes? Does this surprise you in either case?
