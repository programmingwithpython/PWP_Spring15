## equivalent loops

#### while

````python

n = 0
while n < 5:
  print n
  n = n + 1
````

#### for


````python

for n in range(5,):
  print n

````

#### Questions:
+ in the while loop, why would i not want to print n as the last line in the loop?
+ how do n in the `while` loop and n in the `for` loop differ?
