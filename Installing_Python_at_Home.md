# Installing Python on Your Computer

#### Anaconda

If you want Python on your computer at home, you can download the same Python package that we have at BACE. Continuum Analytic's [Anaconda Package](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) is a great all-in-one installation that gives you a lot of useful libraries.  Most of them you won't have a need for at the moment, but Ipython is worth the download alone.  

They do require your email address in order to download Anaconda, but no money or registration is required.
