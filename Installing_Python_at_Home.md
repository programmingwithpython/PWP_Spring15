# Installing Python on Your Computer

#### Anaconda

If you have a **Mac** or **Linux** system at home, you already have Python (probably 2.7).  However, if you want to take advantage of some of the great Python tools out there without wrestling with the installation process, the easiest solution is to download and install Continuum Analytic's [Anaconda Package](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).

This is the same installation of Python that we have on the computers at BACE.  It has a ton of popular and useful libraries (many of which we won't touch in this course), it doesn't interfere with your system Python installation, and it also doesn't require admin priviledges for you to use those libraries in your user directories.

They do require your email address in order to download Anaconda, but not registration or any money.
